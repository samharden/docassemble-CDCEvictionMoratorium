  CR: deleted the concept of online since you are online when you are reading this intro. 
  I also think we should link to page 5 of the order for users of this interview so they can see right away what the order actually is.
id: eviction_moratorium_intro_screen
question: |
  Stop your eviction: Mass Access Project
subquestion: |
 
  The [MassAccess Project](https://massaccess.suffolklitlab.org) asks you questions that help you file forms and write letters during the COVID-19 emergency.
  
  Write a letter to your landlord to tell them about your rights under the Centers
  for Disease Control and Prevention's [eviction moratorium 
  order](https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2020-19654.pdf#page=5). 
  See [this helpful FAQ](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/09/02/your-money/eviction-moratorium-covid.html) from the New York Times.
  
  After you have answered all the questions, you will have a letter and the CDC Declaration form to go with it. You can download, print, and email the letter and form.
  
  To use the letter and form, you must:
  
  1. Earn under the income limit.
  2. Be unable to pay your rent because you lost income.
  3. Be at risk of homelessness or doubling up, "sharing housing in close quarters".
  4. Have tried your best to get governmental rental assistance. And
  5. Have made your best efforts to pay the amount of rent that you can pay, taking into account your personal circumstances.
  
  We will ask you detailed questions to find out if you qualify.

id: moratorium intro
question: |
  Some things to keep in mind
subquestion: |
  Your state may have a moratorium that gives you [more 
  rights](https://evictionlab.org/covid-eviction-policies/).

  * Every adult who lives with you needs to write their own
  letter.
  * The CDC moratorium can only protect you from eviction in some circumstances,
    including being unable to pay your rent. You may still be evicted for
    another reason. Click "Why else can I be evicted?" to learn more.
  * You still may owe rent and fees.
continue button field: form_explanation
help:
  label: |
    Why else can I be evicted?
  content: |
    The CDC order lists 5 reasons you can be evicted even if you qualify for the moratorium:
    
    1. Criminal activity.
    2. Actions that threaten the health or safety of other residents.
    3. Damaging or posing an immediate risk of damaging property.
    4. Violating any building code, ordinance, or regulation relating to health or safety.
    5. Violating any other part of the lease other than failing to pay rent,
    fees, or interest.

question: |
  You may need a different resource
subquestion: |
  Based on your answers, you likely do not qualify for the CDC's
  Eviction Moratorium.
  
  * Keep in mind that your state may have a moratorium that gives you [more 
  rights](https://evictionlab.org/covid-eviction-policies/).
  * Get information from the [Legal Help FAQ on Eviction & Rent 
  Protections](https://legalfaq.org/).
  * [Write your landlord a letter](https://www.norent.org/) that explains
  your situation.

id: qualify best efforts
question: |
  Did you do your best to get government help to pay the rent?

  If you do not qualify for any help from the government,
  or if you applied and you were denied, answer 'Yes.'
yesno: qualifies_best_efforts
help:
  label: |
    What are "best efforts"?
  content: |
    If you applied and followed up for any government rental help or benefits that you
    qualify for, you probably used your "best efforts." You do not need to ask
    for help from friends or family.
    
    "Available government assistance" means any government rental or housing
    payment benefits available to you or any household member.
    
    For example, Section 8 rental assistance, public housing, or temporary help to pay your rent that some cities or states offer.
    The [USA.gov](https://www.usa.gov/finding-home) website has some links
    to resources that can help you find rent assistance programs in your
    area.
