question: |
  Some things to keep in mind
subquestion: |
  Your state may have a moratorium that gives you [more 
  rights](https://evictionlab.org/covid-eviction-policies/).

  * Every adult who lives with you needs to fill out their own
  copy of this form.
  * This form can only stop you from being evicted for non-payment
  of rent. You can still be evicted for other reasons.
  * You still may owe rent and fees.

  label: |
    Why else can I be evicted?
  content: |
    The CDC order lists 5 reasons that someone can be evicted if they
    otherwise qualify for the moratorium:
    
    1. Criminal activity.
    2. Actions that threaten the health or safety of other residents.
    3. Damaging or posing an immediate risk of damaging property.
    4. Violating any building code, ordinance, or regulation relating to health or safety.
    5. Violating any other part of the lease other than failing to pay rent,
    fees, or interest.

id: qualify best efforts
question: |
  Did you do your best to get government help paying the rent?
subquestion: |
  Answer yes if you do not qualify for any help from the government,
  or if you applied and you were denied.
yesno: qualifies_best_efforts
help:
  label: |
    What are "best efforts"?
  content: |
    Available government assistance means any governmental rental or housing
    payment benefits available to the individual or any household member.
    
    For example, state rental assistance, disability payments, or welfare
    benefits.
    
    If you applied and followed up for any rental help or benefits that you
    qualify for, you likely used your "best efforts". You do not need to ask
    for help from friends or family.

  - Check any that apply: cant_pay_reasons
    datatype: checkboxes
    choices:
      - My household lost **substantial** income: substantial
        help: |
          "Substantial" income probably means enough that it

          living expenses.

      - My hours were cut
      - My salary was reduced
      - I have **extraordinary** medical costs that I pay out of pocket (not covered by insurance): extraordinary
        help: |
          An "extraordinary" medical expense is any unreimbursed 
          medical expense likely to exceed 7.5% of one’s adjusted 
          gross income for the year.

id: qualify partial payments
question: |

subquestion: |
  Answer yes even if you are not making any payments if:
  
  1. Your individual circumstances do not allow you to pay any amount.
  2. You have other expenses that are not discretionary that prevent you
  from paying any amount.
fields:

    datatype: yesnoradio

      blank.

      - I would likely need to move into a homeless shelter
      - I would likely need to move in with someone else in close quarters: close quarters
        help: |
          "Close quarters" means that more people than normal would live in the same apartment. For example, sharing a bedroom or sleeping in a shared living space.
      - I do not have any other safe housing choices: safe
        help: |
          Safe housing means any available, unoccupied residential property, or other space for occupancy in any seasonal or temporary housing, that would not violate Federal, State, or local occupancy standards.

question: |
  Read the information below carefully
subquestion: |
  When you file this form, you are agreeing that you understand
  the following:
  
  Even though I may not be evicted before December 31, 2020,
  
  1. I still am responsible to pay my rent and follow all other rules of my lease. My landlord may charge me fees or interest.
  2. At the end of December 31, 2020, I may be required to pay all of the rent 
  due in full. This may depend on the state that I live in. I can talk to an attorney to be sure.
